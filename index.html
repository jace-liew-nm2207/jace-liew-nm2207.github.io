    <div id="text">
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;font-family:Didot">Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forest land use such as arable land, urban use, 
    logged area or wasteland. <br> According to FAO, deforestation is the conversion of forest to another land use or 
    the long-term reduction of tree canopy cover below the 10% threshold. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;font-family:Didot">
    Deforestation is occurring at a rapid rate with increased development and we are not sure how long more the earth can hang on to its last resources left.
    Up to 15 billion trees are now being cut down every year across the world, species are going extinct and millions of lives are affected.
